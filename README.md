This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting wine quality based on various physicochemical properties. The project leverages multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to analyze and model the relationship between wine quality and its constituent elements.

Key Features:
Feature Engineering: New features are created by combining relevant physicochemical properties to enhance model performance.
Data Analysis: Visualization and statistical analysis are conducted to identify strong correlations between different attributes affecting wine quality.
Model Training: Implements Linear Regression and SVR models, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
Performance Evaluation: The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics, providing insights into their predictive accuracy.
Usage:
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
Load the dataset and run the provided scripts to train and evaluate the models.
Modify parameters and explore different features to improve predictions.
This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques in data science and offers valuable insights into the factors influencing wine quality.
